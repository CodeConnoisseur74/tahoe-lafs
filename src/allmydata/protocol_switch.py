"""
Support for listening with both HTTPS and Foolscap on the same port.

The goal is to make the transition from Foolscap to HTTPS-based protocols as
simple as possible, with no extra configuration needed.  Listening on the same
port means a user upgrading Tahoe-LAFS will automatically get HTTPS working
with no additional changes.

Use ``support_foolscap_and_https()`` to create a new subclass for a ``Tub``
instance, and then ``add_storage_server()`` on the resulting class to add the
relevant information for a storage server once it becomes available later in
the configuration process.
