The SFTP server no longer accepts password-based credentials for authentication.
Public/private key-based credentials are now the only supported authentication type.
This removes plaintext password storage from the SFTP credentials file.
It also removes a possible timing side-channel vulnerability which might have allowed attackers to discover an account's plaintext password.
